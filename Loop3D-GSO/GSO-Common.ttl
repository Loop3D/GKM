gsoc:Amount_Of_Matter
  rdf:type owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "Amounts of matter refer to volumes of substances such as some gold, wood, iron, water, air, etc.  As per Lowe (1998), an amount of matter is either a chunk (unified \"part\") or heap (seperated and not unified \"piece\"). A unified chunk of matter is an integral whole (with a unifying condition),  is mereologically invariant (can gain or lose parts without loss of identity), is discretely countable (the number of gold ore bodies or sandstone layers can be enumerated),  has a single self-connected boundary upon which it is mutually ontologically dependent (the chunk cannot exist essentuially without the boundary, and the boundary cannot exist essentially without the chunk), and is a single entity (self-connected, unfragmented). Being an integral whole, a chunk of matter must then have some amount of matter as an essential part  (Brodaric et al. 2019). In contrast, a nonunified heap is mereologically variant, uncountable, and not dependent on a boundary, e.g. a heap of gold grains in an ore body or sand particles on a beach. Moreover, each unified chunk of matter is constituted by an ununified heap of matter, as well as possibly by particles of lower granularity, and can constitute larger amounts of matter or objects: e.g. an amount of mineral is a disaggreated heap of individual unit mineral cells made up by a certain configuration of atoms, and this heap of minerals makes up a single chunk of mineral locked together under binding conditions; the chunk in turn makes up a rock material, which makes up a formation. Note that both chunks and heaps can thus constitute objects: a gold ring is constituted by the chunk and its heap of gold, and a formation is constituted by both the sandstone and its heap of sand and other particles.  Even things that seem to be intrisically heaps, such as a dune, are constituted by both heaps and chunks of matter: e.g. by both a heap of sand particles and a chunk of sand (with a discrete shape and boundary). The chunk (of sand) differs from the object (the dune), in the sense that the dune has additional essential characteristics not held by the chunk, such as being a landform (i.e. located on the land surface), having a specific shape (hilly - even though the chunk has the shape, the shape is not essential to it, but is essential to the dune), and is formed by certain geomorphological processes such as wind or water flow (the sand chunk is formed by eroision and weathering). Distinguishing chunks from heaps is important to geology, as it enables chunks to have characteristics of unified matter, which otherwise would be restricted to objects, e.g. one could not then say, for example, some sandstone hosts a fault, but rather that the rock object part constituted by the sandstone hosts the fault. This then enables detailed representation of micro-scale geology, at the granularity of matter, in addition to representation of macro-scale entities such as units or basins."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "A feature that denotes a manifestation of a pattern. A pattern in GSO is a relation, in two senses: (1) an abstract pattern is a template, which can be expressed as an n-ary predicate with some variables as relata; (2) a manifested pattern is an occurence of the template in some host, and can be expressed as either (a) an n-ary relation with only constants as relata, or (b) an instance of the reification of this relation (i.e. a Relator instance). E.g. wood grain is hosted by some wood matter and the pattern is the reified relation between its wood fibres. Different wood grains are then different (reified and instantiated) relations between its fibres."@en ;

Perdurants are  time regions, such as an interval or instant of time, or they are things that occur in time, such as events or processes. Perdurants have only perdurant parts, and can only have fixed qualities that have unchanging values (e.g. the duration of a time interval); if there is some quality that apparently changes for the perdurant, it is a fixed quality of a part of the perdurant, but is not a quality of the perdurant itself (e.g. the intensity of a process varies over the whole process, but has fixed values for certain time-indexed parts of the process)."@en ;
