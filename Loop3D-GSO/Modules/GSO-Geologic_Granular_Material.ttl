  rdfs:comment "This file contains the categories for describing granular materials-- constituents in a rock material that are a particular kind of particle, defined based on genesis and internal characteristics of the particles. The scheme is intended to be indepenent of the mineralogy of the particles to the extent possible.  Based in part on the 2016 SKOS-RDF version of the CGI  IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group Composition Category vocabulary. Terms to specify the nature of individual particles of each constituent in an aggregation, based mostly on their genesis. Examples include clasts, crystals, material fossil. Constituent type is determined based on the nature of the particles, and ideally is independent of the relationship between particles in a rock material aggregation (which would be roles)."@en ;
