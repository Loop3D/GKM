Terms to specify the nature of individual particles of each constituent in an aggregation, based mostly on their genesis. Examples include clasts, crystals, material fossil. Constituent type is determined based on the nature of the particles, and ideally is independent of the relationship between particles in a rock material aggregation (which would be roles)."@en ;
