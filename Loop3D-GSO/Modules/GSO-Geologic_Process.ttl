  rdfs:comment "Any chemical, physical, or biological process that affects a sedimentary EarthMaterial after initial deposition, and during or after lithification, exclusive of weathering and metamorphism. [adapt. Jackson, 1997] Example processes include compaction, cementation, authigenesis, replacement, leachinghydration, and bacterial action. Includes processes that are normal in the surficial or outer part of the earth’s crust [Jackson, 1997]. Changes in a deeply buried sedimentary rock may be continuous from diagenesis into recrystallization to form a metamorphic rock. Robertson [1999] defines the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism in sedimentary rocks as follows: \\the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism is somewhat arbitrary and strongly dependent on the rock types involved. For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42D.2U obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987, Bucher and Frey, 1994, Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 ± 50° C in silicate rocks. Many rock types may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.\\"@en ;
