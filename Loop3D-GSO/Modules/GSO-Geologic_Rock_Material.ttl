The definition of greenschist is generally something along the lines of 'metamorphosed rock with a greenish colour, characterized by the presence of actinolite, chlorite and epidote, and containing a planar or linear fabric. The presence or absence of schistose fabric in rocks called 'greenschist' is problematic. The fabric present in many rocks called greenschist is too weak or variably developed to meet the definition of 'schist' per CGI SimpleLithology. Generally if the rock has achieved metamorphic grade such that the term 'gneiss' is applicable, it would not be called greenschist. Thus, 'greenschist' would correspond most closely to a chlorite + actinolite rich 'Foliated metamorphic rock', but if it actually meets the definition of 'Schist' it would be a chlorite + actinolite 'Schist'."@en ;

Residual fluids present during the late stages of magmatic crystallization can react with previously formed plagioclase feldspar to form saussurite; the saussurite will be spread through the plagioclase or located near its outer margin. The plagioclase may be reconstituted into a more sodium-rich variety (albite), although the original form of the crystal is retained. Later hydrothermal alteration can produce the same result. Mafic rocks are especially susceptible to saussuritization owing to their high calcium content; the more calcium-rich portions of plagioclase in acidic rocks also are often saussuritized."@en ;

    rdfs:comment "Robertson (1999, Classification of metamorphic rocks: British Geological Survey Research Report, RR 99‚Äì02) defines the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism in sedimentary rocks as follows: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism is somewhat arbitrary and strongly dependent on the lithologies involved. For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42 Delta 2 Theta obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987; Bucher and Frey, 1994; Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 +/- 50¬∞ C in silicate rocks. Many lithologies may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.‚Äù"@en,
