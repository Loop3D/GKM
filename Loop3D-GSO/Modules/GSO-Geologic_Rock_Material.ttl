  rdfs:comment "Particularly for fine-grained sedimentary rocks, distinction of 'intrabasinal' versus 'clastic' genesis can be very interpretive. In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge about the rock being categorized. If it is associated with other clastic rocks, the clastic categories will be favored, if with cabonate rocks, the carbonate categories will be favored. Carbonate rock subcatgories are defined on two orthogonal dimensions--mineralogy (calcitic vs. dolomitic vs non-carbonate impurities), and texture. The texture categories used here are those of Dunham (1962), and involve grain size (matrix vs. grains/allochems), fabric (matrix vs. grain supported), and genesis (bound, frame, or fragmental). The textural approach used for carbonate rocks is conceptually incompatible with that used for clastic sedimentary rocks, which is solely grain size or mineralogy based. This leads to problems in the vocabulary for rocks of mixed siliclastic/carbonate mineralogy (grainstone vs. sandstone, carbonate mudstone vs. carbonate rich mudstone, how to accomodate marlstone...)."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "Rock classified as Greenschist is difficult to categorize in the CGI SimpleLithology scheme. This stems in part from the variation in usage and the general fuzzy definition of the term. The definition of greenschist is generally something along the lines of 'metamorphosed rock with a greenish colour, characterized by the presence of actinolite, chlorite and epidote, and containing a planar or linear fabric. The presence or absence of schistose fabric in rocks called 'greenschist' is problematic. The fabric present in many rocks called greenschist is too weak or variably developed to meet the definition of 'schist' per CGI SimpleLithology. Generally if the rock has achieved metamorphic grade such that the term 'gneiss' is applicable, it would not be called greenschist. Thus, 'greenschist' would correspond most closely to a chlorite + actinolite rich 'Foliated metamorphic rock', but if it actually meets the definition of 'Schist' it would be a chlorite + actinolite 'Schist'."@en ;

Terrigineous clastic was considered and rejected first because it is considered redundant, anything that is terrigineous is clastic. Second, it is questionable if clastic sediment derived by submarine processes (fragementation by gravity sliding, faulting, or volcanic activity, with transport by sediment gravity flow or submarine currents) is terrigineous, but it is clastic and is meant to be included in this category."@en ;

This is based on GeoSciML allowance to assign rocks to more than one lithology category. For example to categorize a rock as a clastic conglomerate requires assignment ot the 'clastic sedimentary rock' category and to the 'conglomerate' category.

For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42 Delta 2 Theta obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987; Bucher and Frey, 1994; Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 +/- 50° C in silicate rocks. Many lithologies may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.”"@en ;

Quantitative grain size analysis in the the clay/silt fraction of a lithified sediment is difficult at best, and of questionable significance because diagensis has altered the size and mineralogy of original sedimentary particles."@en ;

Alunite, topaz, zunyite, tourmaline, enargite and tennantite may also occur. In many cases, advanced argillic alteration zones, or “lithocaps”, develop at shallow levels above porphyry Cu–Au deposits (e.g., Lepanto-Far Southeast, Philippines; Maricunga, Chile). Advanced argillic alteration mineral assemblages precipitate from SO2- and HCl-rich magmatic vapor, which arises from an underlying intrusive source, and can also form in supergene environments, due to post-hydrothermal weathering and oxidation of pyrite, locally creating pH<1 liquid due to high concentrations of H2SO4 within the vadose zone, where kaolinite and alunite plus Fe hydroxides form."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "Rock in which calcium-bearing plagioclase feldspar is altered to an assemblage of minerals called saussurite, typically including zoisite, chlorite, amphibole, and carbonate minerals. Residual fluids present during the late stages of magmatic crystallization can react with previously formed plagioclase feldspar to form saussurite; the saussurite will be spread through the plagioclase or located near its outer margin. The plagioclase may be reconstituted into a more sodium-rich variety (albite), although the original form of the crystal is retained. Later hydrothermal alteration can produce the same result. Mafic rocks are especially susceptible to saussuritization owing to their high calcium content; the more calcium-rich portions of plagioclase in acidic rocks also are often saussuritized."@en ;
