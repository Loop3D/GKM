Algal flats survive only when an area is salty enough to eliminate snails and other herbivorous animals that eat algae, yet is not so salty that the algae cannot survive. The most common species of algae found on algal flats are blue-green algae of the genera Scytonema and Schizothrix. These algae can tolerate the daily extremes in temperature and oxygen that typify conditions on the flats. Other plants sometimes found on algal flats include one-celled green algae, flagellates, diatoms, bacteria, and isolated scrubby red and black mangroves, as well as patches of saltwort. Animals include false cerith, cerion snails, fiddler crabs, and great land crabs. Flats with well developed algal mats are restricted for the most part to the Keys, with Sugarloaf and Crane Keys offering prime examples of algal flat habitat. (Audubon, 1991)"@en ;

Subaerial parts of the delta are crossed by many distributaries of the main river, and commonly extend beyond the general trend of the coast. Subaqueous parts of the delta merge with the adjacent basin floor, and are progressively influenced by non-fluvial processes. Deltas result from the accumulation of sediment supplied by the river in such quantities that it is not removed by tides, waves, and currents.
