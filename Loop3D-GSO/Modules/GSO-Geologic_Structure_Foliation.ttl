  rdfs:comment "A fabric defined the parallel, planar arrangement of mineral grains having a platy, lamellar, or tabular crystallographic habit that are oriented in a continuous planar or rarely a linear fabric. Schistosity is commonly, but not necessarily, a crystalloblastic foliation. Platy mineral grains typically 1 to 10 mm across (Jackson, 1997), at smaller grain size grades into phyllitic cleavage. Schistosity is typically associated with a continuous cleavage due to the tendency to part parallel to the aligned mineral grains."@en ;
